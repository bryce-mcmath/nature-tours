## Known issues / bugs

- The front end of the application is somewhat incomplete, ie. there are features that have yet to be implemented and menu options that don't actually go anywhere. I took the application as far as the course took it, but I'm not invested enough to continue adding to it at this point.

Thanks for viewing!
